Title: Comparative study between Candle, a Rust based ML framework and PyTorch

We have compared the performance of Candle based Rust model of yolov3 with PyTorch based python model of the same.
yolov3 is an object detection model. The code citations have been provided. We have made minor changes in the code to incorporate confidence scores which is a way which we are using to compare the performances of the two.
Another parameter that we are checking for the model accuracy is the number of objects both the models are detecting which we are comparing with what appears correct to the naked eye.
