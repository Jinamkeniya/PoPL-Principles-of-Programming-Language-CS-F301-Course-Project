If given more time, we would compare the performances of various models such as classification and segmentation. There are many ways of comparing performances in classification models such as accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 score, etc. In segmentation, IoU(intersection over union) can be used to compare performance. This way, we might get an overall view if candle is more efficient than pytorch or not.
